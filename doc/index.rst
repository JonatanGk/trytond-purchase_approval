Purchase Approval
=================

Add a document to make explicit the approval of the purchase by an user.

When the purchase is quoted an Approval Request is created. It should be
managed by a member of the Aproval group defined in the purchase.

The purchase can be confirmed only if it has any approved request.

When the purchase is set to Draft from Quotation, all pending and approved
requests are cancelled.
